# Why I'm starting this blog

I left Amazon in November after two and a half years. I felt joy and terror at the same time, as I realized this was the first time I took a break from work in 10 years. The last time was when I decided I didnâ€™t want to be a lawyer anymore: I had no clear idea of what to do next, but I knew I could do anything. And I ended up doing _all the things_.

I will be writing some articles looking back on some work/life lessons learned over the last 10 years as a non-lawyer. Some of them will be very practical, some of them will be about management and corporate values. The culture of a company is built upon the behaviors of the leadership and employees, not on a list of words listed on the website as values (Ben Horowitz calls them virtues in his lates book). Noticing and analyzing the gap between what companies say about their values and what they do has been extremely useful and worth sharing.
